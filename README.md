# Manifold

A macOS desktop app that orchestrates multiple CLI coding agents working in parallel on the same project. Each agent runs in its own git worktree, so agents can work on isolated branches simultaneously without conflicts.

Supports **Claude Code**, **Codex**, and **Gemini CLI**.

## Install

Download the latest `.dmg` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/svenmalvik/manifold/releases), open it, and drag Manifold to your Applications folder.

> **Note:** The app is not currently signed with an Apple Developer certificate. If macOS says the file is "damaged" or "can't be opened", run:
> ```bash
> xattr -cr /Applications/Manifold.app
> ```
> Then open again normally.

### Prerequisites

You need at least one agent CLI installed:

| Agent | Install |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| Codex | `npm install -g @openai/codex` |
| Gemini CLI | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/gemini-cli` |

Git must be installed. For creating PRs from within Manifold, install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`).

## Usage

### First launch

On first launch, Manifold shows a welcome screen where you:

1. **Configure storage** — Choose where agent worktrees are stored (defaults to `~/.manifold/`)
2. **Register a project** — Add a local git repository or clone one from GitHub

### Creating agents

1. Click **New Task** in the sidebar
2. Pick a **runtime** (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, or a custom binary)
3. Give the agent a **prompt** describing what to do
4. Optionally edit the **branch name** (auto-generated, always prefixed `manifold/`)
5. Click **Launch**

Each agent gets its own git worktree branched from the project's main branch. Agents work in fully isolated copies of the codebase, so they never step on each other.

### Working with agents

- **Terminal pane** (left) — Live agent output streamed via xterm.js. Type into the terminal at any time to steer the agent mid-flight.
- **Code viewer** (center) — See file diffs or full file contents as the agent makes changes. Powered by Monaco Editor.
- **File tree** (right) — Browse all files in the agent's worktree. Modified files are marked with a dot.
- **Shell tabs** (bottom) — Open additional shell terminals in the agent's worktree for manual inspection.

Status badges show each agent's state: **running**, **waiting** (for user input), **done**, or **error**.

### Creating pull requests

When an agent finishes, click **Create PR** on the agent tab. Manifold uses the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to open a pull request from the agent's worktree branch to the project's base branch. Title and description are pre-filled for review.

### Key features

- **Parallel agents** — Run multiple agents on the same project simultaneously, each in an isolated worktree
- **Agent-agnostic** — Works with any CLI coding tool
- **AI-assisted commits** — Auto-generate commit messages from diffs
- **Conflict detection** — Alerts when merge conflicts appear in a worktree
- **Persistent sessions** — Agent state, shell tabs, and UI layout survive app restarts
- **Dark / light theme** — Toggle in settings

## Contributing

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/svenmalvik/manifold.git
cd manifold
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` starts Electron with hot reload — changes to renderer code reflect immediately.

### Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start Electron in dev mode (hot reload)
npm run build        # Production build
npm run dist         # Build + package macOS DMG
npm run typecheck    # Full typecheck (main + renderer)
npm test             # Run all tests
npm run test:watch   # Watch mode
```

### Project structure

```
src/
  main/       — Node.js main process (PTY, git, files, settings)
  preload/    — IPC bridge (whitelisted channels only)
  renderer/   — React UI (components, hooks, styles)
  shared/     — Types shared between main and renderer
```

Tests are co-located with source files (`*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx`).

### Pull request workflow

1. Create a feature branch off `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Run `npm run typecheck && npm test` — both must pass
4. Open a PR against `main`

### IPC convention

Adding a new feature that crosses the process boundary requires changes in three places:

1. `src/main/ipc-handlers.ts` — register the handler
2. `src/preload/index.ts` — whitelist the channel
3. The renderer hook that calls it

Channel naming: `domain:action` for request/response, `domain:event` for push events.

## Architecture

Electron three-process model with strict context isolation:

- **Main** (`src/main/`) — Node.js runtime. Owns PTY processes, git worktrees, file system, settings.
- **Preload** (`src/preload/`) — IPC bridge. Whitelisted channels only.
- **Renderer** (`src/renderer/`) — React UI. No direct Node.js access.

### Main process modules

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `SessionManager` | Agent session lifecycle — create, resume, kill, discover dormant worktrees |
| `WorktreeManager` | Git worktree creation/removal under configurable `storagePath` |
| `PtyPool` | PTY process management via `node-pty` |
| `ProjectRegistry` | CRUD for registered projects (`~/.manifold/projects.json`) |
| `SettingsStore` | Config persistence (`~/.manifold/config.json`) |
| `StatusDetector` | Pattern-matches PTY output to detect agent status |
| `DiffProvider` | Git diff between worktree branch and base branch |
| `FileWatcher` | Watches worktree directories, pushes change events to renderer |
| `GitOperationsManager` | Commit, AI-generated commit messages, ahead/behind counts, conflict resolution |
| `PrCreator` | Creates GitHub PRs via `gh` CLI for agent worktree branches |
| `ShellTabStore` | Persists shell tab layout per worktree across app restarts |
| `ViewStateStore` | Persists per-session UI state (open files, active tab, code view mode) |
| `BranchNamer` | AI-generated branch name suggestions from task descriptions |
| `Runtimes` | Discovers available agent CLIs on the system |
